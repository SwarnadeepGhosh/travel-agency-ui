<b>HARIDWAR:</b> Haridwar, lying at the feet of Shiva`s hills, i.e. Shivaliks, in the Haridwar district of Uttarakhand. Suryavanshi prince Bhagirathi performed penance here to salvage the souls of his ancestors who had perished due to the curse of sage Kapil. The penance was answered and the river Ganga trickled forth forms Lord Shiva`s locks and its bountiful water revived the sixty thousand sons of king Sagar. In the traditional of Bhagirathi, devout Hindus stand in the sacred waters here, praying for salvation of their departed elder. It is doorway to the sources of the Ganga and the Yamuna, 3000 to 4500 meters up into the snowy ranges of the central Himalayas. The Aarti worship of the Ganga after sunset and the floating dia (lamp) is a moving ritual
<br><br>

<b>Rishikesh:</b> 24 Kms. from Haridwar, located in the laps of lower Himalayas, and is surrounded by scenic beauty of the hills on three sides with Holy Ganga flowing through it. The whole place is considered to be sacred as it is believed that meditation at this place leads to attainment of salvation. There are many temples some ancient, some new along the river Ganges. Rishikesh is important not only as pilgrimage centre closely associated with the Ramayana, but also as home for many important centres of Hindu religious thought and spirituality, and as a very great Yoga Centre. There are many ashrams and Yoga institutes here. Rishikesh is also the gateway and the start-off point for journeys to important religious places like Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotri.
<br><br>

<b>Mussoorie:</b> It is a well-known hill station nestled in the Dehradun District of Uttarakhand in the region of North India. Being situated in the foothills of the Garhwal Himalayan ranges it is often referred to as the Queen of the Hills. In 1820, a British Army officer set up this town. Mussoorie is not only famed for its picturesque splendor but it has also urbanized into an imperative center of education and trade over the course of time. Nestled in the Himalayan foothills it reflects a royal look with its dense jungles, comfortable atmosphere and the wonderful views of the Doon Valley. The name of the place is derived from the Mansur shrub established in profusion around this region. Vestiges of its colonial past are still reflected in the architecture of this town. Mussoorie tourism has got many places of tourist interest such as outstanding natural sights like Childer`s Lodge or Gun Hill, the two highest peaks and the eminent Kempty cascade.
<br><br>

<b>Nainital:</b> Nainital is a Himalayan resort town in the Kumaon region of Indiaâ€™s Uttarakhand state, at an elevation of roughly 2,000m. Formerly a British hill station, itâ€™s set around Nainital Lake, a popular boating site with Naina Devi Hindu Temple on its north shore. A cable car runs to Snow View observation point (at 2,270m), with vistas over the town and mountains including Nanda Devi, Uttarakhand highest peak.
